# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Our project will use Pandas and Python for data cleaning, manipulation, integration and analysis. 

## Database Storage
After cleaning and analyzing our data, we will use PostgreSQL server. We will then use a Postgres query to join the data and further connect it to our Machine Learning Model.

## Machine Learning
We will be using the method of linear regression and Prophet for our Machine Learning Model. Also using the seaborn library in our analysis. 

## Dashboard
We will use Python & HTML for the dashboard to view and analyze the difference in our snack bar results.
