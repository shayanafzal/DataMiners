# DataMiners

Role Circle -- Database design and mockup

## Creation of a database

A mockup database "DataMiners" was created in PG Admin as seen in the below image. The table "sales_data" was created manually using the SQL query saved in the file "Sales_Data_Schema". Since this is a mockup database to be created using a single dataset file, ERD was not prepared. Our project is to predict future sales based on the historical data from July 2013 - June 2021.

## Files used for creating database
